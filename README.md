# Stripe Integration Example

This project is a demonstration of how to integrate the **Stripe** payment system with a web application. It includes functionalities for user registration, authentication, and subscription checkout. This is a flexible example that can be adjusted to meet your specific needs.

## Features

- **User Registration**  
  When a user registers, their data is stored in a **MongoDB** database, and a corresponding user is created in **Stripe**.

- **Login**  
  Users can log in using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication, enabling secure access to protected routes.

- **Subscription Checkout**  
  After logging in, users are redirected to a subscription page where they can complete their payment process.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the environment variables with your **Stripe API key**, **Stripe ID Plan**, **Stripe WebHook key** and **MongoDB connection string**.
3. Run the backend server and the frontend application.
4. Test the registration, login, and subscription flow.
